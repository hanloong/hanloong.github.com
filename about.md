A software engineer living in Sydney Australia. Mostly dealing with web development in Rails but like many Rails programmers I had a previous career as a PHP developer.

I spent too many years as a developer not challenging myself and learning new things. In 2013 I changed that by quitting my cushy job and learning a new language. Now I am having trouble sticking to learning a single language. I hope to record any useful things I stumble upon in my learnings and share them on this blog.
