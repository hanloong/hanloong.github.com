[Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) is an easy to use idea voting platform for businesses and private communities. It allows employees to get involved in the direction of a company by sharing ideas, providing feedback and voting for idea's they find valuable.

## Why?

In the past I have worked for companies with similar systems and I found it a great way to bring a wide variety of knowledge into one place. It's Ithaka's opinion that anyone within a company can come up with the next great idea that could change their workplace, if not the world.

However a suggestion box is only so useful and for people to really want to share idea's they need to receive good feedback and see progress. With [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) everyone can vote for idea's they like, contribute to the discussion around an idea and get updates when a idea's status changes.

Okay so some of you are probably saying just because an idea is popular that doesn't been it should be brought to life. Well I totally agree, peoples support is important but not the only thing to considered when a decision is made. Each idea in [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) has something called **influence**, basically the owner of a project can rate an idea on factors like **potential revenue**, **productivity**, **risk** and **workplace moral** which are visible to everyone. These score are combined and used as a multiplier against the number of votes to produce an overal score for an idea. The idea's with the best scores are then shown at the top of each project heping your business decide what to tackle next.

## Where is it at?

At this stage [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) is in a very early stage of development, the concepts listed above are all up and working but there is so much on my todo list (seriously). So as [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) is still in beta everything is **FREE**. I want people to use it, break it and let me know how I can improve it.

The future plan is to charge a fee based on team sizes but I think [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) first needs to be validated as something worth while. So please check it out and let me know your thoughts.
