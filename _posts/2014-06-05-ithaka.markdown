[Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) is an easy to use idea voting platform for businesses and private communities. It allows employees to get involved in the direction of a company by sharing ideas, providing feedback and voting for idea's they find valuable.

## Why?

In the past I have worked for companies with similar systems and I found it a great way to bring a wide variety of knowledge into one place. It's Ithaka's opinion that anyone within a company can come up with the next great idea that could change their workplace, if not the world.

However a suggestion box is only so useful and for people to really want to share idea's they need to receive good feedback and see progress. With [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) everyone can vote for idea's they like, contribute to the discussion around an idea and get updates when a idea's status changes.

Okay so some of you are probably saying just because an idea is popular that doesn't been it should be brought to life. Well I totally agree, peoples support is important but not the only thing to considered when a decision is made. Each idea in [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) has something called **influence**, basically the owner of a project can rate an idea on factors like **potential revenue**, **productivity**, **risk** and **workplace moral** which are visible to everyone. These score are combined and used as a multiplier against the number of votes to produce an overal score for an idea. The idea's with the best scores are then shown at the top of each project heping your business decide what to tackle next.

## Where is it at?

At this stage [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) is in a very early stage of development, the concepts listed above are all up and working but there is so much on my todo list (seriously). So as [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) is still in beta everything is **FREE**. I want people to use it, break it and let me know how I can improve it.

The future plan is to charge a fee based on team sizes but I think [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) first needs to be validated as something worth while. So please check it out and let me know your thoughts.

## Building [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) - Hosting

So now that you know what it is, here is some of the how.

[Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) is a pretty standard **Rails** app so my first choice for hosting was of course **Heroku**. I have worked for companies that were hosted on **Heroku** and still have a few projects on development dyno's. However once I started getting into the nitty gritty of supporting a business application it started to get pretty expensive, quickly. And for a bootstrapped side project price is pretty important.

### Why I left Heroku

So a single development dyno is free, but it goes to sleep if its not used which is not acceptable, so thats around $34 for a 2x dyno (still pretty cheap). Then add $9 for a non-dev postgres database (still okay). Oh [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) definitely needs to send out emails and they should be handled out of band by DelayedJob or something similar, okay so thats another $34 for each worker (a bit more expensive). Finally this is a business app so everything should be over SSL, hmm thats $25 per month for an SSL endpoint, really? I'm not sure why hosting the SSL certificate should cost $25 a month when a full app dyno costs $34.

The SSL was just a little too much to handle so I looked around and was seriously considering moving over to **Digital Ocean** but I have little faith in my sys admin abilities and I wanted to keep my focus on building the product and not the infrastructure (at least not yet).

### Why I moved to ninefold

Being a Sydney sider I was pretty familiar with **Ninefold** but had never deployed anything with them. So it turns out for a "thrifty" person such as I it was possible to get everything I need, always on, SSL, workers and database for about $35 if I used a single server. Which was all I needed as I didn't really have any customer base yet.

So the price was definitely better but what about the everything else?

So far I have found the speed to be comparable. Running it through [webpagetest.org](http://www.webpagetest.org) and [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) mainly pointed out things I could needed to fix rather then my hosting provider, I also liked the fact that gzip was enabled by default.

Having SSH access in addition to a cli tool is also something I have enjoyed. And like **Heroku**, **Ninefold** offer a "experimental" **zero downtime deployment** feature when you are lucky enough to have multiple app servers.

### Now what I miss

I have noticed its a little harder to integrate deploying to **Ninefold** from some of the hosted continuous integration services that are out there, this is something that **Heroku** seem to do really well, although as they are the big dog in rails hosting I guess that makes sense. While its just myself on this project its not an issue as I can run a script locally but if the team grows it would be nice to have deployment integrated into a pull request type workflow back by a testing run.

When I was testing **Ninefold** I had [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) on a single server (web + worker + db) which worked well as a staging environment but I found that there was no upgrade path from a single server to a separate db + app and I found migrating a database from one app to the another to be a little more difficult then it should be. As there was only testing data on the staging server I ended up just throwing away the old system and building from scratch. However this is definitely something that needs improvement in my opinion.

### Wrap Up

So there is a short introduction to my side project. I'm have created a blog specifc to [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) at [blog.ithaka.io](http://blog.ithaka.io) just incase this ideation tool turns into something real. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any thoughts.

Thanks

## Disclaimer

After my first month on ninefold they kindly offered to assist with six months of free hosting, which should allow [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) to handle a substaintial spike in traffic if I ever get that lucky..
