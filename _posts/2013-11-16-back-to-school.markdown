In the past few months I have switched jobs, languages (programming that is), version control system and last but not least my editor. Its been quite an adjustment but I have never been more excited about being a software engineer. However I don't want this to come off as a problem with my last job because it wasn't the job, it was me. I had become stuck and I needed a reason to push myself to improve. The people I worked with were great but I had dug myself into a hole that I needed to get out of.

So with this switch I have had to learn a lot of new stuff. I mostly used the internet for learning material and wanted to share what I used and let you know what I found helpful. Personally I'm not great at reading technical books so the majority of these are tools that have some practical element.

### Free Tools
 - #### (http://tryruby.org)[Try Ruby]
 
 This is a great little tutorial to get started with ruby syntax and is actually included in code schools ruby path.

  If you are lucky/unlucky enough to live in a larger city there might just be a meetup group for ruby and/or rails. In Sydney there is the ruby on rails oceania group which holds free tutorial classes and help you get ruby and rails setup on your laptop which can be a challenge for newcomers.

 - #### conf freaks

 So this resource is probably for people a bit further along the ruby road but its a excellent resource for diving deeper into topics.

 - #### exercism.io

  This one is also for people a bit further along but is a great site created around the idea of code kata and code review. The basic concept is that there are a bunch of challenges that you attempt and each challenge has a completed spec or test file. Then once you complete your program and all the tests pass you submit it to the site and the other members of the site will provide feedback.
