As a developer at Flatmates I work on all parts of the web app. From user interface to server management in AWS. We're a small team running a fairly busy site so being comfortable with all parts of our stack is critical. It's not uncommon for a work day to include refactoring SASS and updating chef scripts.

 - OpsWorks
 - Postgres, Elasticsearch, Redis
 - Sidekiq
 - ReactJS, Flux

 - Ported our search system form giant controller methods to small testable service objects.
 - Built an emailing system to help members advertising properties find relevant matches. Our email system is our largest source of revenue and this became the 3rd largest source.

YourTutor provides an on-demand online tutoring tool connecting qualifieds tutors with primary school, high school and university students in Australia.

The engineering team comprises a team of full stack engineers (mostly remote), a designer, product manager and team lead. The team followed an agile-ish methodology with two weeks spreets with people rotating into different roles each sprint to help share knowledge and keep things interesting. As the team had no dedicated Dev Ops or Sys Admin roles developers need to be involved in managing servers and deploying code.

- Postgres, Redis
- Ansible
- Sass

#### Highlights

- Re-designed our EventMachine servers to allowing it scale horizontally horizontally using Redis as a queueing backend.
Rolled out A/B testing frameworks (split) to help us perform multi-variant testing mostly for features around acquisition (pricing, sign up flow etc).
Upgraded our main Rails app from 3.2 to 4.x making sure we continue to keep up to date so as to avoid big ugly upgrades.
- Built a load testing/smoke testing tool to run against production after deploys. I used PhatomJS and poltergeist to simulate a large number of tutors and students logging onto our system and connecting to each other.
- Helped lead the efforts into using service objects, view models and form objects to help organise and unit test a large app.
- Lead the implementation ReactJs components as a move away from backbone.
- Helped increase the reliability and frequency of our deploys by formalising out github pull request workflow in documentation.
