## Work History
### [Ithaka](https://ithaka.io) - Side project (Sydney, Australia)
Ithaka is an ideation platform for small to medium businesses. It helps companies collect organise and qualify ideas and suggestions from employees. The main differentiation to other “ideation platforms” would be the influence system that measures ideas on different factors which then influences the power of each vote. The hope is that the combination of popularity and domain expertise will help uncover the most valuable ideas.
This side project allowed me to test out patterns and technologies that interested me while making sure the work I was doing had a real use case. It uses
- Ruby on Rails
- Postgres
- ReactJS - with server side rendering
- Stripe Payments
- Google Apps API
- Sass
- Coffeescript

### [yourtutor.com.au](http://yourtutor.com.au) (Sydney, Australia)
##### Software Engineer (2013-Current)

YourTutor provides an on-demand online tutoring tool connecting qualifieds tutors with primary school, high school and university students in Australia.
The engineering team comprises a team of full stack engineers (mostly remote), a designer, product manager and team lead. The team followed an agile-ish methodology with two weeks spreets with people rotating into different roles each sprint to help share knowledge and keep things interesting. As the team had no dedicated Dev Ops or Sys Admin roles developers need to be involved in managing servers and deploying code.

- Ruby On Rails
- EventMachine (Reactive ruby library)
- Socket.io
- Redis
- Postgres
- Backbone
- ReactJs
- SVG (for our interactive whiteboard)
- Ansible (for provisioning our servers AWS)
- Sass
- AWS - EC2
- Coffeescript

#### Highlights
- Re-designed our EventMachine servers to allowing it scale horizontally horizontally using Redis as a queueing backend.
Rolled out A/B testing frameworks (split) to help us perform multi-variant testing mostly for features around acquisition (pricing, sign up flow etc).
Upgraded our main Rails app from 3.2 to 4.x making sure we continue to keep up to date so as to avoid big ugly upgrades.
- Built a load testing/smoke testing tool to run against production after deploys. I used PhatomJS and poltergeist to simulate a large number of tutors and students logging onto our system and connecting to each other.
- Helped lead the efforts into using service objects, view models and form objects to help organise and unit test a large app.
- Lead the implementation ReactJs components as a move away from backbone.
- Helped increase the reliability and frequency of our deploys by formalising out github pull request workflow in documentation.
- Researched and tuned Ruby GC settings after seeing unbounded memory growth when moving to ruby 2.1.
- Improving our overall test coverage and my understanding of TDD and testing in general with things like Rspec 3 and verified mocks.
- Helped organise our large mono-rail app into modules and introduced the use of service objects (even though “service” is a poor name)
